	<h1>Good Vibes Friend! Welcome to my internet homepage & Portfolio. I’m Alejandro, Nice to meet you! </h1>
	<p>Sometimes we need a rerun of certain classes and skills. As I enter my next career phase, I am using this page to demonstrate my understanding of programing skills. I created this portfolio for a programing class at Bellevue College during the winter 23’. You will notice that I have added pet projects, code clippings and write ups from career. •	Take a look at some of my class work going as far back from my early days at WWU, to my days at UW, and now my road at BC. Feedback is a gift, hopefully this site can help you on your journey.
